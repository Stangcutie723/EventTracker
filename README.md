EventTracker
============
A web app that lets the user keep track of dates! EventTracker shows you a list of dates 
not to forget and can be edited by the user. Never forget that birthday or anniversary again!
You can add, edit and destory any event too!

(What I used): Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Html, CSS, JavaScript
